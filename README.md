# FancyIrb [![version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fancy_irb.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fancy_irb)  [![[ci]](https://github.com/janlelis/fancy_irb/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/janlelis/fancy_irb/actions?query=workflow%3ATest)

*   Colorizes IRB prompts, errors, `$stderr` and `$stdout`
*   Uses "Hash Rockets" (# =>) to display IRB results

## Usage

    require 'fancy_irb'
    FancyIrb.start

You can pass an options hash. These are the default values:

    DEFAULT_OPTIONS = {
      :rocket_mode     => true,       # activate or deactivate #=> rocket
      :rocket_prompt   => '#=> ',     # prompt to use for the rocket
      :result_prompt   => '=> ',      # prompt to use for normal output
      :unicode_display_width => true, # set to false if you don't want to check for proper
                                      # string width for better performance
      :colorize => {                  # colors hash. Set to nil to deactivate colors
        :rocket_prompt => [:blue],
        :result_prompt => [:blue],
        :input_prompt  => nil,
        :irb_errors    => [:red, :clean],
        :stderr        => [:red, :bright],
        :stdout        => nil,
        :input         => nil,
       },
    }

Rocket mode means: Output result as comment if there is enough space left on
the terminal line and `stdout` does not output more than the current terminal
height.

## Troubleshooting
### Windows Support
You will need [ansicon](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon) or [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/).

### Need More Performance?
The gem checks for the Unicode display width of characters, which requires a
lookup of every character. You can deactivate this check by setting
 `:unicode_display_width` to `false`.

### Known Bugs
Not all stdin methods are patched properly to work with the rocket: The gems
focuses on the often used ones

## J-_-L
Inspired by the irb_rocket gem by genki.
